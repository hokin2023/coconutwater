# Book Search Engine 

## Description

Refactor a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API as a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The original app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It was already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.

This assignment includes:
1. Setting up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API,
2. Modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API,
3. Creating an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server, and
4. Deploying the application to Heroku with a MongoDB database using MongoDB Atlas.
